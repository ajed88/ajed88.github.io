### Machine Learning


- [Glioma Modeling](https://github.com/ajed88/Glioma_ML) I learned various models, optimised parameters, and used a number of evaluation metrics to refine a custom ensemble model for predicting High or Low grade gliomas.
- [Divorce Modeling](https://github.com/ajed88/Divorce-Predictors) Using Random Forest on a Divorce dataset to produce a predictive model, and determine the most and least important attributes.
- [Formula 1 Laptimes](https://github.com/ajed88/formula1-laptime) A detaset containing information about drivers, venues, lap position amongst others, was used to train a Random Forest model and a Gradient Boost model using sci-kit learn, and a Neural Network using tensorflow libraries, making use of one-hot  encoding for all models. These all underwent hyperparemeter tuning and 5-fold nested cross-validation. These models then predicted the laptimes from a second dataset with laptime information removed.
